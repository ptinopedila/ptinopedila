The goal is to create a set of images for economists and econ-labs.

Our goal is to deliver a versatile and streamlined environment, minimizing barriers to academic work for economists and data scientists.

Current issue is the size of the images and the limited resources github provides for free.

## Images

### Homelab

Large images to set up an optimal work-from-home environment for your desktop or laptop.

Currently built on top of [bluefin-dx](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin).

- ptinopedila-homelab
- ptinopedila-homelab-nvidia

## Documentation

This project is based on [Universal Blue](universal-blue.org) and [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/). We will try to stay close to upstream, which is constantly improving and evolving. The changes we make will be documented in detail.

For econ-specific tools and programs please open an issue in this repository. Documentation on how to install proprietary software and work with containers will soonâ„¢ be available.

For more info, check out the [uBlue homepage](https://universal-blue.org/) and the [main uBlue repo](https://github.com/ublue-os/main/)

## Installation

> **Warning**
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable) and should not be used in production, try it in a VM for a while!

To rebase an existing Silverblue/Kinoite installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:

  ```sh
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/ptinopedila/ptinopedila-homelab:latest
  ```

- Reboot to complete the rebase:

  ```sh
  systemctl reboot
  ```

- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:

  ```sh
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ptinopedila/ptinopedila-homelab:latest
  ```

- Reboot again to complete the installation

  ```sh
  systemctl reboot
  ```

This repository builds date tags as well, so if you want to rebase to a particular day's build:

```sh
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ptinopedila/ptinopedila-homelab:20230403
```

This repository by default also supports signing.

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.
